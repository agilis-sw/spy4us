The files in this repo are part of an effort to predict one day percent gain of the S&P 500.

I call this application 'spy4.us' because the stockmarket provides an ETF named SPY.

So if I can predict gains of the S&P 500, a good way to act on those
predictions is to buy/sell SPY in my brokerage account.

The software in this repo is divided into two parts.

The first part calculates the predictions from prices of GSPC.

The second part copies the predictions to a meteor application.

Then I rely on meteor.com to serve the predictions to you when you
want to see them in your browser.
